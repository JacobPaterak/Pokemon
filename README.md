Pok√©mon Type Matchup Guide

This is a simple React-based web application that lets users look up any Pok√©mon type and see:

- Which types it is **strong against** (does double damage to)
- Which types it is **weak to** (takes double damage from)
- Which types it resists or is immune to (takes half or no damage)

The data is fetched from the free [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), which provides real-time type matchup info.
